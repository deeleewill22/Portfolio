## Introduction

#### What is an API? APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow applications to communicate, enabling features like data retrieval, updates, and automation.

Example: A weather app uses an API to fetch real-time weather data from a weather service, such as
``` https://api.weather.com/v1/today?city=Austin. ```

### Types of APIs

1. REST APIs (Representational State Transfer): Uses HTTP methods for communication, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
2. SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol): Uses XML-based messages and specific formatting rules for more rigid data structure.
3. GraphQL: Allows clients to request only the data they need, rather than a fixed response.

Examples:
1. REST API: ```GET https://api.example.com/v1/products``` retrieves a list of products.
2. SOAP API:
3. GraphQL: A client might query ```https://api.example.com/graphql``` for only the product names and prices, reducing data transfer.

## Authentication

API Keys and Tokens: These are unique identifiers for authenticated access to the API.

Example: API key ```abc123-key``` is provided as a query parameter (```?api_key=abc123-key```) or in the headers (```Authorization: abc123-key```).

### Types of Authentication:

1. Bearer Token: Requires a token that is passed in the request headers.

Example: ```Authorization: Bearer abc1234-token``` sends the token in the request headers for secure access.

2. OAuth: Uses an access token exchange process that grants access for specific scopes, often used for third-party applications.

Example: A user grants access to their Google Calendar through OAuth, and the API returns an access token.

### Managing API Tokens: Tokens should be stored securely and refreshed periodically.

Example: Use environment variables (```process.env.API_TOKEN```) in your application to avoid hardcoding tokens directly in the codebase.

### Endpoints

Understanding Endpoints: Endpoints specify the resource or action available at a particular URL.

Example: ```https://api.example.com/v1/users``` could retrieve or manage user data.

### Common HTTP Methods:
1. GET: Retrieves data without changing the server state.

Example: ```GET /products``` fetches a list of all products.

2. POST: Submits data to create a new resource.

Example: ```POST /products``` with data like ```{"name": "New Product", "price": 19.99}``` to create a new product.

3. PUT: Updates an existing resource.

Example: ```PUT /products/123``` with data like ```{"price": 29.99}``` to update the price of the product with ID 123.

4. DELETE: Removes a resource.

Example: ```DELETE /products/123``` deletes the product with ID 123.

## API Request Structure

Headers: Headers provide additional context or information about the request.
Example:
1. Authorization: Bearer abc1234-token for secure access.
2. Content-Type: application/json to specify the data format.
3. Body: Contains the data youâ€™re sending to the server, typically in JSON format.

Example: To create a new user, the request might look like:

```{"username": "new_user", "email": "new_user@example.com","password": "password123"}```

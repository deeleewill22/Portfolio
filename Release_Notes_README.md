## A new version of the User Management (UM) application is now available for installation. This release
introduces a self-service upgrade option, meaning the Gamma team will not be handling upgrades across
client sites.

## Improvements:
1. Faster application load time.
2. Better filtering across columns.
3. More dynamic logging and error messaging.

## Bug Fixes:
1. <bold>“Unable to load” error message:<bold> Increased memory capacity to support loading larger data sets
without errors.
2. <bold>Pricing emails for unverified users:<bold> Added a user verification workflow in the UM app to
automatically verify both new and existing users, ensuring that pricing emails are only sent to
verified users.

## New Functionality:
1. Added the ability to export data into an Excel worksheet.
2. Added integration between the UM app and Tableau for better reporting.
3. Added the ability to sort columns and save the column order (users can achieve this by selecting
the “preserve my settings” checkbox in the top right hand corner on their report).
